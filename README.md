Here is how to install this pack.



First, navigate to the folder labeled "1" and open it.

Inside the folder, you will find several resources. Drag and drop all of these resources into your FiveM server resources folder.

After that, navigate to the "ND_Core" folder within the resources folder.

In the "ND_Core" folder, open the file "config_server.lua" with a text editor such as Notepad or Sublime Text.

Edit the file with your own server information, Discord bot token, and so on. Save the file.

Then, open the file "config_client.lua" in the same way and edit it with your own client-side settings. Save the file.

Now, navigate to the "[ND]" folder within the resources folder.

Here, you can edit anything to your liking within this folder, such as changing the jobs, dealership, character selection, and so on.

Once you're done editing, go back to the main resources folder and open the folder labeled "2".

Inside the "2" folder, you will find some SQL files. Import these SQL files into your database management system (such as phpMyAdmin) to set up the necessary tables and data.

After importing the SQL files, open the file "server.cfg" in a text editor and edit it to your liking, such as changing the server name, the player slots, and other server settings.

Finally, delete the server cache folder (if it exists) and restart your FiveM server.

That's it! You should now be able to run the resources and enjoy the features of this pack.
